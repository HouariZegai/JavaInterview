## Problem: Two Sum
### Description
Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly** one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

##### Example:
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

##### Solution:
* Solution #1: using **brute force** => Complexity: **O(nÂ²)**
*  Solution #2: using **Map** data structure => Complexity: **O(n)**
*  Solution #3: using **Set** data structure => Complexity: **O(n)**
